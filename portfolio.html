                For this project, we decided to look into the free Data provided by the city of Austin. Specifically,
                we looked into the Austin Animal Center Data to try and gather insights into pet adoptions. For our
                first iteration of the project, we focused only on dogs. Do pure breds get adopted faster than mixed
                breeds?
                What is the average time a dog spends in the shelter? Which dog has been in the shelter the longest?
                etc.
                Take a look at our analysis and find out the results!

                For this project, we decided to look into the Scooters Data that exists for the City of Austin.
                From that Data we built a WebApp using SQL, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Plotly, HTML, CSS, Jinja and deployed
                through Google Cloud Run. Take a look and check out the findings!

                In this challenge, I used Python to create a script to analyze the financial records of
                a "fake" company based on a given csv of data. Various metrics are calculated and printed out
                to the terminal as well as a text file.

                In this challenge, I am using Pandas to clean up/munge some data for a "fake" video game.
                I then use that data to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful
                insights. Additonal libraries used were numpy and os.

                In this challenge, I used Python to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap API to answer the question of,
                "Whats the weather
                like as we get closer to the Equator". From the JSON's retrieved, I created several scatter plots to
                analyze various
                relationships between Temperature, Latitude, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed.
