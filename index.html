                I was born and raised in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca' target="_blank">Oaxaca,
                    Mexico</a> and lived
                there for 12 years.
                My mother, sister and I moved to Austin, TX at that time and have been here ever since.
                I went to High School at Westwood High School.
                I went to University at Texas State University where I graduated with a degree in Business Management &
                a Latin American Business Certificate.
